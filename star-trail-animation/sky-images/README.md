# Folder for background images with the Gaia sky.

This folder is expected to contain the images used as background to the star trail animations. They are
not stored in this Github repository. The image names are hard-coded as `GaiaSky-colour-2k.png` and
`GaiaSky-colour-4k.png` in [`star-trails-animation.py`](../star-trails-animation.py). The images used for the Gaia EDR3 can be found here for example (links to the
EDR3 versions of the sky maps will follow):

The 2000x1000 and 4000x2000 versions were used for the [Full
HD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution#FHD) and [4K
UHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution#4K_UHD) videos, respectively.
